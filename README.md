### What does it do?

Green is an idea for an identity microservice. The scenario is: You configure your website / microservice / mobile app / whatever to point to CG.Green, and it takes care of all the messy identity related details, for you. 

### What does it look like?

This is all very subject to change. But here's a sample of what I have, so far:

### What runtime(s) does it support?
